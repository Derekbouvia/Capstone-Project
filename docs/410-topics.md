# Topic Ideas

ðŸ’¡During design, you are going to pick your top two topic ideas and do some preliminary analysis and decomposition on them to get an idea of the projects overall scope. These are two topics of interest to me, ordered in priority. The second of these two topics is essentially a backup idea should the exploration of the first be unsatisfactory.

* Logging and Management Infrastructure for cyber.local

  * Aim to build a logging and management infrastructure for cyber.local

* APT Demonstration and Analysis

  * Choose an Advance Persistent Threat and providing documentation, videos, and a test platform as a training and awareness tool for cyber defenders.
