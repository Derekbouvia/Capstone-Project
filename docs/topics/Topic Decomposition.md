### Logging and Management Infrastructure for cyber.local

The following mindmap and outline represents an initial decomposition of the Logging and Management topic. This topic will be applied to cyber.local. The ultimate goal of this project would be to create a new logging and management infrastructure for cyber.local including dashboards that show system status, logged on users, resource utilization and security events.

# Mindmap

## Network Infrastructure

I broke this down into two sections, the Virtual infrastructure and the physical infrastructure. In order to design and implement a Logging and Management Infrastructure for cyber.local both these will need to be address.

#### Physical Infrastructure

This will include the actual equipment that will be used to support the logging and management infrastructure. Once it is determined what will be needed in order to efficient provide for what is required for the cyber.local logging infrastructure to run and if there is hardware already available or if other hardware needs to be purchased.

#### Virtual Infrastructure

This will include the building and configuring of all the services that will be used for the purpose of this service.

#### Monitoring Solutions

I will be breaking down the specific options to be used for monitoring and what is requested for the project whether that be Wazuh or Elk or a combination of both as well as different things to consider with each lik the security ease of use etc.

#### Build documentation
