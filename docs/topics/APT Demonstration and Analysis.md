# APT Demonstration and Analysis

##  Topic Definition

Advanced Persistent Threats are real and prevalent in todays world. They are targeted cyberattacks 

## Topic Overview

At first I was not aware what an APT was but after doing a few quick searches it quickly became a topic of interest. I think this would be a great opportunity to learn more about what APT's that are put there. I also think this would be a great project to help with my documenting skills as well as providing training and awareness.

## Topic Description

I plan to investigate different advanced Persistent threats, choose one of the more prevalent and or heavily impactful ones. Once decided on a specific one I plan to research their techniques, create a full lifecycle demonstration of all stages of the attack process with the ultimate goal of providing documentation, videos, and a test platform as a training and awareness tool for cyber defenders.
